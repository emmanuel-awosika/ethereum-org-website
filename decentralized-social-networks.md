Today, social media platforms play a huge role in how we communicate and interact with each other. Social networking services have gone beyond mere fads and now underpin the digital economy. 

However, centralized control of these platforms has created many problems. Data breaches, server outages, deplatforming, censorship, privacy violations—these are some of the trade-offs social media users are forced to accept. 

To combat these issues, developers are building novel social media applications on decentralized networks like Ethereum. Decentralized social networks are poised to fix the the ills of legacy social platforms and improve the overall user experience. 

## What are decentralized social networks? {#what-are-decentralized-social-networks}
Decentralized social media networks are blockchain-based platforms that allow users to exchange information as well as publish and distribute content to audiences. Because these applications run on the blockchain, they are decentralized and resistant to censorship and undue control. 

Many decentralized social networks exist as alternatives to established social media services, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Medium. But blockchain-powered social networks have a number of features that put them ahead of traditional social platforms. 

## Why do decentralized social media platforms matter? {#decentralized-social-media-benefits}

To understand the benefits of decentralized social media networks, it's important to compare them against traditional social networks:

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Information is stored on the blockchain.                                                                                | Information is stored in servers and data centers.                                              |
| Global distribution of nodes reduces the possibility of outages.                                                        | Highly susceptible to network failure and service downtimes.                                    |
| Users can enjoy privacy in communication.                                                                               | Users are forced to exchange privacy for free access.                                          |
| Well-designed monetization framework comprising NFTs, in-app crypto payments, and more.                                 | Poor monetization models.                                            
| Blockchain security protects users from malicious attacks and safeguards data.                                          | Centralization increases the risk of data breaches and identity theft.                          |
| Platforms are censorship-resistant and open to everyone.                                                                | Individual access is controlled by centralized entities; platforms can be shut down. 
| Source code and algorithms are fully available for inspection. Users can vote on platform changes in cases.             | Opaque implementation of algorithms. 

### How do decentralized social networks work? {#decentralized-social-networks-overview}
Decentralized social networks are a class of [decentralized applications (dApps)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/)—applications powered by [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) deployed on the blockchain. The contract code serves as the backend for these apps and defines their business logic. 

Traditional social media platforms rely on databases to store user information, program code, and other forms of data. But this creates single points-of-failure and introduces significant risk. For instance, Facebook's servers infamously [went offline for hours](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/05/1043211171/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-outage-business-impact) last year, cutting off users from the platform. 

Decentralized social media website exist on a peer-to-peer network comprising thousands of nodes around the globe. Even if some nodes fail, the network will run uninterrupted, making applications resistant to failures and outages. 

Using decentralized storage systems like the [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/), Ethereum-based social networks protect user information from exploitation and malicious use. No one will sell your personal information to advertisers, neither will hackers be able to steal your confidential details. 

Many blockchain-based social platforms have native tokens that power monetization in absence of advertising revenue. Users can buy these tokens to access certain features, complete in-app purchases, or tip their favorite content creators. 

## Decentralized social networks on Ethereum {#Ethereum-social-media}

The Ethereum network has become the preferred tool for developers creating decentralized social media networks owing to the popularity of its tokens (ERC-20/ERC-721) and its massive user base. Here are some examples of Ethereum-based social networks:

- Peepeth

[Peepeth](https://peepeth.com/) is a blockchain-based microblogging site similar to Twitter. The dApp runs on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store user data.

Users can send short messages called "Peeps", which cannot be deleted or modified. You can collect tips or tip anyone on the platform in ether (ETH) without leaving the app.

- Mirror

[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) is a decentralized and user-owned content distribution platform similar to Medium. Users can sign up by connecting their wallets or providing an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) username.

Posts published on Mirror are permanently stored on Arweave, a decentralized storage platform. Users can earn money by selling their articles as [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/).

- MINDS

[MINDS](https://www.minds.com/) is considered one of the more popular blockchain social media platforms out there. It works like Facebook, and has racked up millions of users already.

Users use the platform's native ERC-20 token $MIND to pay for items. You can also earn $MIND tokens by publishing popular content, contributing to the ecosystem, and accepting advertising offers.

## Ethereum and legacy social media platforms {#Ethereum-and-legacy-social-media-networks}

Decentralized social media platforms aren't the only ones trying to incorporate blockchain technology. Traditional sites are warming up to integrating Ethereum into their infrastructure.

For instance, Reddit has [touted Community Points](https://cointelegraph.com/news/reddit-to-reportedly-tokenize-karma-points-and-onboard-500m-new-users), which are ERC-20 token that users can earn by posting quality content and contributing to the online community. You can redeem these tokens to gain exclusive privileges and perks.

Early this year, Twitter Blue [rolled out support for NFTs](https://mashable.com/article/twitter-blue-nft-profile-picture), allowing users to connect their wallets and display NFTs as profile pictures. The social media company has also [announced plans](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627435/twitter-bluesky-lead-jay-graber-decentralized-social-web) to create a decentralized social network in future.
